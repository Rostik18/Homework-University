My nation, exhausted, broken,
Like the paralitic at the road crossing,
By human contempt, paralized, likely scab, covered!

Your future spirit I disquiet,
From the shame, by which your tardy descendants
will burn, I can not fall asleep.

Is it not so, that for you on steel posters
It is written by your neighbors that you're manure?
Pulled in swifly moving trains?

Is it not so, that forever your allottment will be
Consealed anger, mistaken submission
In everything, that is traitorous and disuniting.

You were chained and sworn to loyalty?
Is it not so, you have not judged the situation,
That has revealed your strength ineffective?

Is it not so, that without cause, so many hearts did burn
Toward you with the most holy of love,
Offering you their soul and body?

For nothing, your nation is all drenched in the blood
Of your fighters? Already it does not strut about
In beauty, freedom, and health?

For nothing, there in your words sparkle
Strength, and softness, endurance, and might,
And everything, by what the spirit is able to lift itself up?

For nothing, your songs pour out melancholy,
And resounding laughter, and the sorrows of love,
Hope and joy - a luminos streak?

Oh no! Not the same tears and sighing
That had judged you! I believe in the strenth of the spirit
In the resurrection day of your arising.

Oh if it could be a moment given here to these words
And a word given, so in that blessed moment
There'd be restoration from a living discharge of fire!
