O lovely maidens, fall in love,
But not with Muscovites,
For Muscovites are foreign folk,
They do not treat you right.
A Muscovite will love for sport,
And laughing go away;
He’ll go back to his Moscow land
And leave the maid a prey
To grief and shame...
It could be borne
If she were all alone,
But scorn is also heaped upon
Her mother frail and old.
The heart e’en languishing can sing –
For it knows how to wait;
But this the people do not see:
“A strumpet!“ they will say.
O lovely maidens, fall in love,
But not with Muscovites,
For Muscovites are foreign folk,
They leave you in a plight.
Young Katerina did not heed
Her parent’s warning words,
She fell in love with all her heart,
Forgetting all the world.

The orchard was their trysting-place;
She went there in the night
To meet her handsome Muscovite,
And thus she ruined her life.
Her anxious mother called and called
Her daughter home in vain;
There where her lover she caressed,
The whole night she remained.
Thus many nights she kissed her love
With passion strong and true,
The village gossips meanwhile hissed:
“A girl of ill repute!”
Let people talk, let gossips prate,
She does not even hear:
She is in love, that’s all she cares,
Nor feels disaster near.
Bad tidings came of strife with Turks,
The bugles blew one morn:
Her Muscovite went off to war,
And she remained at home.
A kerchief o’er her braids they placed
To show she’s not a maid,
But Katerina does not mind,
Her lover she awaits.
He promised her that he’d return
If he was left alive,
That he’d come back after the war –
And then she’d be his wife,
An army bride, a Muscovite
Herself, her ills forgot,
And if in meantime people prate,
Well, let the people talk!
She does not worry, not a bit –
The reason that she weeps
Is that the girls at sundown sing
Without her on the streets.
No, Katerina does not fret –
And jet her eyelids swell,
And she at midnight goes to fetch

The water from the well
So that she won’t by foes be seen;
When to the well she comes,
She stands beneath the snowball-tree
And sings such mournful songs,
Such songs of misery and grief,
The rose .itself must weep.
Then she comes home - content that she
By neighbours was not seen.
No, Katerina does not fret.
She's carefree as can be -
With her new kerchief on her head
She looks out on the street.
So at the window day by day
Six months she sat in vain....
With sickness then was overcome,
Her body racked with pain.
Her illness very grievous proved.
She barely breathed for days ...
When it was over - by the stove
She rocked her tiny babe.
The gossips’ tongues now got free rein.
The other mothers jibed
That soldiers marching home again
At her house spent the night.
“Oh, you have reared a daughter fair.
And not alone beside
The stove she sits - she’s drilling there
A little Muscovite.
She found herself a brown-eyed son...
You must have taught her how!...
Oh fie on ye, ye prattle tongues,
I hope yourselves you’ll feel
Someday such pains as she who bore
A son that you should jeer!
Oh, Katerina, my poor dear!
How cruel a fate is thine!

Where, with a fatherless young child,
A haven will you find?
Who’ll ask you in and welcome you,
No husband at your side?
Your parents now are - strangers too,
It's hard with them to 'bide!
Now Katerina’s well again;
Again out on the street
She gazes through the window pane,
While rocks her babe to sleep;
She looks in vain as days pass by....
Will it, then, never be?
She’d to the orchard go to cry
If people didn’t see.
At sunset Katerina goes
To their old trysting-spots,
Her baby cuddled in her arms,
And whispers as she walks:
“I waited here for him to come,
And here we stood and spoke,
While here... oh here... my son, my son!”
And then her voice is choked.

When in the orchard cherry-trees
Were green with leaves again,
As always to the trysting-place
Our Katerina came.
But now her heart’s no longer light
And now she sings no more,
As waiting for her Muscovite
She did the spring before.
Now Katerina does not sing,
But curses her sad fate.
Ill-wishers in the meantime give
Free rein to spite and hate –
They are preparing evil things.
What can she undertake?
Her lover’d put a stop to this....
But he is far away,

He does not know that heartless folk
Harass his promised bride,
He does not see, he does not know
How Katerina cries.
Perhaps her lover’s lying dead
Beyond the Danube wide;
Or maybe - back in Moscow land
He has another bride!
No, he’s not killed, he is alive –
It can’t be otherwise!
And where another could he find
With such fair face and eyes?
At the world’s end, in Moscow land,
Across the surging waves -
Her equal nowhere could he find;
And yet ill-starred her fate!...
Her mother gave her a fair face,
And lovely eyes bestowed?
Yet how to give her happiness
Her mother did not know.
But beauty without fortune is
A flower in the grass –
Seared by the sun, bent by the winds,
And plucked by those who pass.
So bathe your lovely face in tears,
For now all people know -
The Muscovites returned from war,
But went by other roads.

II

Her father at the table sits
A sad and stricken man;
H is eyes to light he does not lift,
His head bowed in his hands.
Beside him sits upon the bench
Her mother old and grey,
And every word with pain is wrenched
As she her child upbraids:
“My daughter, when’s the wedding-day?

Where does your bridegroom rest?
Where are your bridesmaids, tell me pray,
And all the wedding guests?
They are far off in Moscow land!
So go and seek them there,
Ana don’t tell anyone you have
A mother anywhere.
Be cursed the hour when you were born!
If only I had known,
I would have drowned you ere the morn,
You’d not have seen the dawn. ..
Then you’d have been the serpent’s prey,
While now - a Muscovite’s...
Alas, my daughter, blossom gay!
Alas, my sunshine bright!
So tenderly I tended you,
So proud to see you grown,
Yet all my care is brought to ruin. ..
Oh dear, what have you done?'
So that’s your thanks!... You’ve made your choice,
So go - in Moscow find

Your mother-’n-law, heed her advice,
Since you did not heed mine.
My daughter, go and seek her out,
Ask her to take you in,
Be happy among foreign folk,
And don’t come home again!
Do not come back to us, my child,
From that land far away....
Oh who, without you, daughter mine,
Will lay me in the grave?
Who o’er my body will lament
As but a daughter weeps?
And who a guelder rose will plant
There where my body sleeps?
Who for my sinful soul will pray,
Alas, when you are gone?
My only child, my daughter dear!
Now go. leave us alone,
Go, go from us...”
With failing hand

She blessed her for farewell.
“May God be with you!” To the floor
She then unconscious fell…

Her grey-haired father then found speech:
“What are you waiting for?”
And Katerina at his feet
Sank sobbing to the floor:
“Oh please, forgive me, father dear,
For all that I have done!
My darling dad, forgive me, please,
For what I did that’s wrong!”
“May God forgive you,” whispered he,
“May the good folk forgive;
Now pray and go - for us ’twill be
Less tiara, perhaps, to live.”

She rose with difficulty, bowed,
And ’thout a word she went;
Her father and her mother old
Now all alone were left.
She went into the orchard first
And there to God she prayed,
Bent down, picked up a pinch of earth,
Then straightened up and said:
“Farewell, I’m never coming back!
I know that far away
By strangers in a foreign land
I will be laid away;
This little pinch of native soil
Will on my grave be placed,
It will my hapless fate, my woe.
To strangers there relate....
Nay, let untold my tale remain
When I have fled this life,
Let folks forget my very name
And speak no word of spite.
You’ll not recount my sorry lot....
But he - oh, he will tell

That I’m his mother! Oh, my God!
Where can I hide myself?
Beneath the waves my hiding-place
I’ll find, I am afraid,
While you my sin will expiate –
A roving homeless waif
Without a father!”
                   And she wept
As down the village street,
Her baby in her arms, she went
With slow, reluctant feet.
The village now was left behind –
Her heart with sorrow ached;
She turned to look, then like a child
She stood and loudly wailed.
Beside the road, a poplar tall,
She stood lamenting long;
Her scalding tears fell fast as falls
The dew before the dawn.
She didn’t see a thing for tears
Were streaming from her eyes,
She hugged her baby to her heart,
And kissed it as she cried.
The angel didn’t understand,
Just felt the fond caress
And fumbled with its tiny hands
To find its mother’s breast.
A flaming bowl, the sun went down
Behind the leafy wood;
She wiped her tears, then turned around
And trudged along the road....
Then she was gone. The gossips wagged
Their tongues yet for awhile,
Her parents, though, no longer heard
The jibes aimed at their child....
Such are the wrongs that people do
To people on the earth!

One person’s jailed, another slain,
Himself destroys a third....
And all for what? Nobody knows.
The world is large and wide,
Yet some are homeless and alone,
And can’t a shelter find.
Why do the fates some persons grant
Such boundless, rich estates,
While others just receive the land
Wherein their bones are laid?
Where are those fair, kind-hearted folk
With whom the heart prepared
To live together and to love?
Alas, they’ve disappeared!
On earth there is fortune –
On whom does it smile?
On earth there is freedom –
On whom does it shine?
On earth there are people –
All silver and gold.
They seem strong and wealthy,
Yet fortune don’t know –
Nor fortune, nor freedom!
 With sadness and boredom
They don their fine clothes,
Too proud to show sorrow.
Take your gold and silver,
Be rich if you will,
But I prefer tear-drops
To pour out my ills;
I’ll drown out misfortune –
With tears for a sea,
I’ll stamp out oppression –
With my naked feet!
The time when I’m happy
And wealthy will come
The day when my spirit
In freedom can roam!

III

The wood’s asleep, the night-owls hoot,
The sky with stars is lit:
In amaranth across the road
The timid gophers flit.
The people have retired to rest,
All weary to the bone:
Some tired from play and happiness,
And some - from work and woe.
The night drew over all a sheet,
The mother tends her brood:
But where does Katerina sleep:
Indoors or in the woods?
Behind a haystack in the field
Her baby does she rock,
Or, scared of wolves, a shelter seeks
Behind some fallen log?
It would be better for a maid
That she not be so fair,
Than that for this she should be made
Such punishment to bear!
What fortune does the future hold?
Alas, it will be bad!
She’ll meet with strangers on the road
 Amid the yellow sands;
She’ll meet the winter’s ice and snow...
But him - ah, will she meet
The one who Katerina loves,
And who his son will greet?
If she were with him, all her ills,
Her woes would be forgot:
He’d speak to her with tender words
And hold her to his heart....
Well, we shall hear and we shall see...
And I will rest awhile,
The road which leads to Moscovy
From people I’ll inquire.
Ah, brothers, it’s a long, long road –

Alas, that road I know!
My very heart is gripped with cold
When I recall that road.
One time I trod that road myself –
Would I’d not known that trail!...
About that journey I would tell,
But who’d Delieve my tale?
‘The so-and-so is telling lies!”
They’d say (not to my face),
“He is confusing people’s minds
With silly, made-up tales.”
You’re right, good people, you are right!
Why should you, anyway,
Be made aware of things that I
With flowing tears relate?

What use is it? Each person has
Enough of his own griefs....
So let’s forget it! Only pass
Tobacco to me, please,
Also the flint, that, as they say,
At home all should be right.
For if you’d hear my shocking tale,
You’d nightmares have at night!
So to the devil with it all!
While I had better map
The route our Katerina shall
With tiny Ivan tramp.
Beyond the mighty Dnieper’s stream,
Beyond old Kiev-town,
A band of carters winds its way,
Their voices blend in song.
Returning from a pilgrimage,
Perhaps, a woman nears,
A matron young. But why so sad,
Why are her eyes in tears?
Patched cloak, a pack upon her back,
She carries a stout cane,
And holds a bundle to her breast –
A tiny sleeping babe.
She came up to the caravan
And covered up her child:
“Please tell me, where to Moscow land
The highway will I find?”
‘To Muscovy? This is the way.
Is’t not too far, my dear?”
‘To Moscow. Ana for Jesus’ sake,
Please help me to get there!”

She trembled as she took the coin:
Oh, it was hard to take!..
Why should she beg? ...But there’s the boy –
Her child she can’t forsake!...
She wept, then onward went. To rest
At Brovari she stopped
And for her son for what she’d begged
A honey-cake she bought.
A long time Katerina trudged,
And ever asked the way;
Full many nights beside a hedge
She and her infant lay…

What use are eyes so beautiful - it’s clear:
Beside a hedge with bitter tears to weep!
So look, and mend your ways, oh maidens fair,
That you some day should not be forced to seek
Some Muscovite, as Katerina seeks....
Then do not ask why folks with anger speak
And do not let you in their house to sleep.

Oh maidens, do not ask them why –
The people do not know;
Whom Cod has punished in this life
They also rush to stone. ..
The people sway like willow shoots
Are swayed by vagrant winds.
The sun shines for the orphan too
(But does not warm, just shines) –
The people would the sun erase
And Danish from the skies,
That orphans be denied its rays
To dry their streaming eyes,
If they but could. Ana yet, good God!
Why such a thorny lot?
What harm to people has she done?
What do the people want?
That she should suffer!... Oh my dear!
Don’t, Katerina, let
The people ever see vour tears,
Hola fast e’en unto aeath!
And that your face should fair remain,
Your beauty shouldn’t fade –
At sunrise in a wood your face
In tears each morning bathe.
Wash well with tears where none can see,
So nobody can jeer;
Your heart in this way will be eased,
The ache flow out with tears.

Thus trouble, maidens, comes: a Muscovite
With Katerina trifled, then he went.
Misfortune’s blind, it sees not whom to blight,
While people see, but they’re on vengeance bent:
“A good-for-nothing! Let her die,” they say,
“Since she to guard her virtue didn’t know!”
Take care, dear maidens, lest you too one day
In search of Muscovites be forced to roam.

Where’s Katerina now?
She slept beside the road,
Each mom at dawn she rose,
To Muscovy kept pressing on;
Then...! Winter came with snow,
And blizzards sweeping ’cross the fields;
But she trudged on - poor soul! –
With shoes of bast upon her feet,
And in a shabby cloak.
Thus doggedly she onward went;
When stop - what’s that she sees...?
They’re Muscovites, they’re marching men....
Oh!... Katerina reeled....
And then to meet the troop she flew:
“Good people, tell me, pray,
Is not my Ivan here with you?”
“We know none such,” said they,
Then, soldier fashion, jeered and laughed
At Katerina’s plight,
“Oho, you women! Know our lads!
We fix the girls, all right!”
She looked at them with scornful eye:
“And yet you’re men, you say!
There, there, my baby, don’t you cry!
Let come whatever may,
I will not stop, I will go on ...
Your father I will find,

I’ll give you to him, darling son,
Ana I myself will die.”
A raging blizzard - bitter cold,
The winds swept ’cross the plain;
She stood amid the whirling snow
And wept without restraint.
Tired out at last, the howling storm
Gave way to fitful sighs;
Our Katerina’d cry some more,
But her tears, too, ran dry.
She looked long at her sleeping son:
The wee face, washed with tears,
Was pink and looked as in the morn
A dew-wet rose appears.
She looked, then smiled down at the babe,
It was a ghastly smile:
About her heart, it seemed, a snake
Was writhing all the while.
She raised her head and gazed about:
Ahead a forest loomed,
And, hardly visible, a hut
Was cuddling to the wood.
“Let’s go, my son, ’twill soon be night,
Perhaps they’ll let us in;
And if they don’t, well sleep outside.
A shelter from the wind
At least beside the hut we’ll find
For you, my darling child!
Where will you spend your nights when
I No longer am alive?
Outdoors with dogs, my sorry mite,
Without a bed or roof!
The dogs are bad, the dogs will bite,
The dogs can’t talk with you,

Can’t tell you fairy-tales, or laugh...
With dogs you’ll scrouge for food....
Oh, what misfortune’s come to pass!
Whatever shall I do?”

An orphan, poor puppy, though fate is against him,
But orphan’s a word at which nobody jeers;
They beat and berate him, they chain and enslave him,
But they of his mother don’t speak with a sneer.
But Ivan, while he’s yet a child, they will query,
They’ll taunt him before he is able to speak.
Who huddles ’neath hedges in tatters and hungry?
At whom do the dogs all yap on the street?
Who guides the blind beggar? The bastard, poor creature....
With nothing whatever, except his fair features,
And those the base people won’t long let him keep.

IV

Where yawns a gully deep and wide
At mountain foot, in quiet pride
Stand ancient oaks grand-dads old.
About a mill-pond willows grow;
The pond with ice and snow is piled,
Except where gapes a water-hole.
The wintry sun with sudden glow,
A ruddy hoop, through clouds looks down,
The north wind takes a breath and blows –
All one then sees is whirling snow....
And hears the forest’s mournful moan.

A snow-storm rages. Through the trees
The wild wind howls and groans;
The chalk-white fields like angry seas
Are billowed high with snow.
The forest warden stepped outdoors

To see how fared the trees,
But what’s the use! In such a storm
What could a person see?
“Oh what a din! We’ll have to let
The forest mind itself!
Back to the hut.... But wait - what’s that?
Well, may they roast in hell!
It looks as though the devil's hosts
Are trotting down the road.
Nichipor, look! Those are not ghosts,
They’re horsemen white with snow!”
“What Muscovites? Where Muscovites?”
‘There, there, calm down, my dear!...”
“Where are the Muscovites, my friends?”
“See for yourself, out there!”
And Katerina flew outside
Just as she was from bed.
“That Moscow’s sure got ’neath her hide!”
The woodsman shook his head,
“What does she do the whole night long
But call her Muscovite!”
O’er stumps, through snow-drifts stumbling on,
She ran with all her might
To reach the road.
Then breathless stopped,
Stood barefoot in the snow.
The troop drew close, at jogging trot
They all on horses rode.
“Oh my poor fate!” She ran ahead
To meet them.... Then she spied
 The captain riding at their head:
“My Ivan dear!” she cried,
“My lover, you have come at last!
Where were you all this while?”
She ran to him... his stirrup grasped...
He looked, then turned aside
And to his steed he gave the spur.
“My love, why do you flee?

Don’t you know Katerina more?
Don’t you remember me?
Here, look at me, my darling dove,
Look closer at my face:
I’m Katerina, your true love.
Why do you turn away?”
But he kept spurring on his steed
As though he did not see.
“Oh, wait a moment, darling, wait!
D’you see - I do not weep.
You do not recognize me, dear?
Oh Ivan, it is true -
I’m Katerina, don’t you hear!”
“Let go, you silly fool!
Here, men, drag this mad wench away!”
“Oh God, what’s this you do?
You cannot cast me off this way –
You promised to be true!”
“Take her away! Why do you wait?”
“Take who? Take me away?
What have I done to earn that fate?
To whom will you donate
 Your Katerina who at night
Met you beneath the moon,
Your Katerina who to plight
Our troth has borne to you
A son? Oh Ivan dear, at least
Don’t you reject me too!
I’ll be your slave.... Love whom you please,
I’ll say no word to you....
Make love to all ... I will forget
I ever loved you true....
Bore you a son, became unwed
A mother ’cause of you....
An unwed mother... What a shame!
Why am I thus undone!

Then leave, forget me, but I pray,
Do not forsake your son.
You will not leave him?... Oh my dear,
Don’t haste away from me....
I’ll bring your son to you out here.”
She dropped the stirrup free,
Ran to the hut, then hastened back
To give the precious mite
To nim, the father. Loosely wrapped,
It wailed from cold and fright.
“Here is your son, your bonny boy,
Come see! Where have you gone?
He’s fled!... The father ran away!...
The father spumed his son!
Oh God!... My poor abandoned mite!
Whatever shall I do?
I beg you, gentle Muscovites,
Take him away with you!
Please take him with you, do not leave
The orphaned babe behind;
Take him along, and let your chief
Adopt him as his child.
Take him.... Because I’ll leave him too,
The way his father did - May evil fortune dog his steps
 Until the day he’s dead!
Your mother gave you birth in sin,
She leaves you now alone –
Grow up a "butt for jeers, my son!”
She laid him on the road.
“Stay here to find your father, lad,
For I already tried....”
The little baby cried,
Abandoned in the snow....
The men, Unmindful, passed it by.
It would have been as well; but then

The woodsmen heard its cry.
Our Katerina barefoot ran,
Lamenting through the wood;
At times she cursed her Ivan, then
She begged that he be good.
She left the wood behind, then saw
The mill-pond down below....
She dashed across the ice and stopped
Beside the water-hole.
“O God, accept my soul, I pray,
And you - my body take!”
A splash...! Then only bubbles stayed
The water’s calm to break.
Young Katerina found at last
What she’d been looking for!
The wind puffed once - and e’en a trace
Of footsteps was no more.
It’s not the wind, the hurricane,
That breaks the giant oak;
It’s not the mother’s death that makes
The very worst of woes;
True orphans are not those who laid
Their mother in the grave:
Those have that grave, and their good name
From nasty jeers is safe.
Ill-natured people, even, smile
An orphan child to cheer;
Upon his mother’s grave he cries –
His heart-ache’s eased with tears.
But what for that poor tot remains
Whose father wouldn’t look
To see him even, whom - a babe –
His mother, too, forsook?

What’s harder than the bastard’s lot?
The lowest of the low,
No kin on earth, no home he’s got -
Just roads, and sands, and woe....
Patrician face with eyebrows dark....
What for? So he’d be known!
She didn’t hide the father’s mark...
Oh, would there had been none!


V

Beside the road to Kiev-town
A kobzar sat to rest.
With him his guide, a little boy
In rags and tatters dressed.
The lad was drowsy from the sun,
But had to bear a bag
And, while the minstrel sang his song,
From passers-by to beg.
Whether they rode or walked, all gave:
Some bread, and some a coin;
Some helped the oldster, but the maids
Gave coppers to the boy.
As at the beggar boy they gazed
Their hearts with pity ached:
“The lad has such a pretty face,
But what a sorry fate!”
Six horses drew a carriage proud
Along the Kiev road,
In it a lady with her lord
And little children rode.
In clouds of dust the coachman reined
There where the beggars sat.
The lad ran quickly, for the dame
Had beckoned with her hand.
She gave some money to the boy
And watched with smiling eyes.

The master glanced... then turned away....
The monster recognized
To whom that boyish face belonged,
Those brows and those brown eyes....
The father recognized his son,
But coldly turned aside.
The lady asked the lad his name.
“Small Ivan, ma’am,” he said.
“What a sweet child!” And then away
In dust the carriage sped....
The beggars counted what they’d got
In alms so far that day,
Turned to the sun to pray to God,
Then went their weary way.
