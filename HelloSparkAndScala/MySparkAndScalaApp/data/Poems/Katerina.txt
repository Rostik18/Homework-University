O lovely maidens, fall in love,
But not with Muscovites,
For Muscovites are foreign folk,
They do not treat you right.
A Muscovite will love for sport,
And laughing go away;
He’ll go back to his Moscow land
And leave the maid a prey
To grief and shame...
It could be borne
If she were all alone,
But scorn is also heaped upon
Her mother frail and old.
The heart e’en languishing can sing –
For it knows how to wait;
But this the people do not see:
“A strumpet!“ they will say.
O lovely maidens, fall in love,
But not with Muscovites,
For Muscovites are foreign folk,
They leave you in a plight.
Young Katerina did not heed
Her parent’s warning words,
She fell in love with all her heart,
Forgetting all the world.

The orchard was their trysting-place;
She went there in the night
To meet her handsome Muscovite,
And thus she ruined her life.
Her anxious mother called and called
Her daughter home in vain;
There where her lover she caressed,
The whole night she remained.
Thus many nights she kissed her love
With passion strong and true,
The village gossips meanwhile hissed:
“A girl of ill repute!”
Let people talk, let gossips prate,
She does not even hear:
She is in love, that’s all she cares,
Nor feels disaster near.
Bad tidings came of strife with Turks,
The bugles blew one morn:
Her Muscovite went off to war,
And she remained at home.
A kerchief o’er her braids they placed
To show she’s not a maid,
But Katerina does not mind,
Her lover she awaits.
He promised her that he’d return
If he was left alive,
That he’d come back after the war –
And then she’d be his wife,
An army bride, a Muscovite
Herself, her ills forgot,
And if in meantime people prate,
Well, let the people talk!
She does not worry, not a bit –
The reason that she weeps
Is that the girls at sundown sing
Without her on the streets.
No, Katerina does not fret –
And jet her eyelids swell,
And she at midnight goes to fetch
